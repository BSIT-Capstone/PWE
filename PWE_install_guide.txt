	-Microsoft Reporting Services is configured and installed. 
	-Windows authentication for users accessing Microsoft Reporting Services.
	-Reports for Microsoft Reporting Services have appropriate permissions for users to access and download.

	 *Note you do not have to change the value for ReportFolder if you keep the same naming convention for the folder.

	-Follow the comments to provide urls for ReportService2005 and ReportExecution. 
	*These urls are provided when you install and configure Microsoft Reporting Services. 
	URL structure: "http://yourdomainname.com/ReportServer/ReportService2005.asmx"
